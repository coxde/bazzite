[![Build Image](https://github.com/coxde/bazzite/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coxde/bazzite/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Purpose ü§î

This repository is for my personal OS image, very much based on my own needs. It's based on [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/) and a template published by the [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) Project.

## Features ‚ú®

-   Additional RPM and Flatpak packages
-   JetBrainsMono Nerd Font; Papirus icon theme and folder theme
-   Justfiles: AppMan, Fish, Nix
-   LibreWolf and KeePassXC workaround in Flatpak

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Rebase

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

-   First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
    ```
    rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/coxde/bazzite:latest
    ```
-   Reboot to complete the rebase:
    ```
    systemctl reboot
    ```
-   Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
    ```
    rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/coxde/bazzite:latest
    ```
-   Reboot again to complete the installation
    ```
    systemctl reboot
    ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build.

## Verification ‚úÖ

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/coxde/bazzite
```
